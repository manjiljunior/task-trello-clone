# Project: Trello Clone

## Tech Stack:
  - **TypeScript**
  - **Next.js (App Router)**
  - **Styled-Components**  
    - I chose styled-components instead of TailwindCSS because many modern projects heavily use Tailwind and AI also tends to default to Tailwind examples. Using styled-components helps demonstrate custom CSS-in-JS abilities and differentiates the project.
  - **Framer Motion**
  - **dnd-kit**
  - **React Context**  
    - Since this is a simple project, React Context is enough for managing global state instead of introducing a heavier state management library.
